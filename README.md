Project Summary

In real estate it's useful to know the state of repair of a property. The aim of this project is to build a classification algorithm using deep learning to predict the condition of a property.

Training data consists of pictures of kitchens with 3 possible target labels. Below are the categories and the number of images in each category:
Poor-192
Average-1032
Good - 1639

As this is not a large dataset my initial approach would be to:
Apply some augmentation to generate more images
Then apply some transfer learning as a baseline model
